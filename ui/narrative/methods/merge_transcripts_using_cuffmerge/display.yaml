description : |
    <p>Cuffmerge creates a merged set of transcripts from several input assembly GTF files from Cufflinks that can be used by Cuffdiff. It essentially acts as a meta-assembler.</p>
    <p>During this merging transcripts from all the assemblies are converted to representative reads and Cufflinks is run internally to see of there is any gaps that can be filled and a longer consensus sequence can be created. Basically, Cuffmerge merges transcripts that are overlapping  and share a similar exon structure (or splicing structure) to generate a longer chain of connected exons.</p>
 
    <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This method is one of the steps of the <a href= "http://kbase.us/rna-seq/"> KBase RNA-seq Pipeline </a> and is not intended to run standalone.</p>
