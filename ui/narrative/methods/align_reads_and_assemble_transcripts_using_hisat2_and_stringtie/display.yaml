description : |
  <p>This method aligns the sequencing reads for a set of two or more samples to long reference sequences of a genome using HISAT2 and outputs a set of alignments for the given sample set in BAM format. Alternatively, if the user has only a single sample of reads, this method will take single-end or paired-end library object instead of a sample set.</p> 

  <p>In addition, it outputs the alignment statistics such as total reads, mapped and unmapped reads, singletons, multiple alignments, and alignment rate in the table format.</p>

  <p>Finally, the method assembles transcripts for a given sample or a sample set using StringTie so that you can view the relative abundances of the assembled transcripts in a histogram. </p>

  <p>HISAT2 is essentially a successor of TopHat2 and is relatively faster and more sensitive while still maintaining low memory requirements. The HISAT2 index is based on the FM Index of Ferragina and Manzini, which in turn is based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform. The algorithm used to build the index is based on the blockwise algorithm of Karkkainen.

    <p>STringTie is a successor of Cufflinks that is faster and provides more accurate reconstruction of genes and expression level. It accepts aligned RNA-seq reads from HISAT2, TopHat2 or Bowtie2 and assembles the alignments into a parsimonious set of transcripts. It then estimates the relative abundances of these transcripts based on how many reads support each one, taking into account biases in library preparation protocols.</p>

    <p>The StringTie output object contains GTF and FPKM files. The GTF file contains annotated transcripts assembled by StringTie whereas the FPKM file gives the normalized abundance of each transcript expressed in fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM) and transcripts per kilobase million (TPM). The StringTie Table Histogram tab displays the abundance of normalized gene expression value in both log2(FPKM+1) and log2(TPM+1).</p>

    <p>This method runs StringTie only once, to directly produce read coverage tables.  This is the "simplified protocol" noted in the StringTie manual.  Note that this protocol does not attempt to find any novel transcript isoforms.

  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This method is one of the steps of the <a href= "http://kbase.us/rna-seq/"> KBase RNA-seq Pipeline </a>, however it can also be run standalone for one or more RNA-seq samples.</p>
